## üéØ ETC3250/5250 Overview  

::: f2

Business analytics involves uncovering the hidden information in masses of business data using statistical graphics, models and algorithms. The most widely used prediction and classification models will be covered. Practical skills in applying techniques to different problems will be developed using a suitable software environment that involves doing reproducible analyses. Topics to be covered include [**dimension reduction**]{.monash-blue} with methods such as **principal component analysis**, [**supervised learning**]{.monash-blue} with methods such as **linear models**, **discriminant analysis**, **decision trees** and **forests**, **support vector machines**, **neural networks**, and [**unsupervised methods**]{.monash-blue} such as **k-means clustering**. Techniques for **numerical optimisation**, **Monte Carlo simulation**, and [**resampling methods**]{.monash-blue} including **bootstrap**, **cross-validation**, and **bagging** will be discussed. Modelling will include **nonlinear relationships** and **nonparametric methods**.

## üéØ ETC3250/5250 Learning Objectives


::: callout-important

## Learning objectives

1. Select and develop appropriate models for clustering, prediction or classification
2. Estimate and simulate from a variety of statistical models
3. Measure the uncertainty of a prediction or classification using resampling methods
4. Apply business analytic tools to produce innovative solutions in finance, marketing, economics and related areas
5. Manage very large data sets in a modern software environment
6. Explain and interpret the analyses undertaken clearly and effectively

## üèõÔ∏è ETC3250/5250 Materials & Expectations

* **2 hour lectures** 
* **1.5 hour tutorial**
  - only go to the one you are assigned to!
  - bring your laptops for in-person tutorials
* All materials (including link to lecture slides, tutorials, recorded lecture videos and assessment instructions will be available) on Moodle.
* Tutorial solutions will be provided after the tutorial.
* Attend lectures, assigned tutorials and consultation hours as needed.
* **_Minimum_** total expected workload is 144 hours, that's 12 hours each week or **8.5 hours of self study per week**.


## ‚úã Consultation Hours

* A total of **7.75 hours of consultation _each week_**. 

* See Moodle announcement for the Zoom links or location for the consultations.
  
* _Seek help early and often_! We are here to help!

* For coding issues, check out [this guide](https://learnr.numbat.space/chapter3) to make it easier for others to help you.






## üíª Programming with R 

- In this unit, we use the statistical software **R**.
- You are expected to know already the basics of R as part of the prerequisite of this unit. 
- If you need to brush up on your R skills, check out [**https://learnr.numbat.space**](https://learnr.numbat.space/).
- Make sure you have the latest R and RStudio installed.


## üíØ Course assessments

* 10% for Assignment 1 *due Week 6*
* 10% for Assignment 2 *due Week 9*
* 20% for Assignment 3 *due Week 11*
* 60% for final Exam *scheduled later*

All assessments are individual assessments. You may discuss questions (except for the exam) but you must provide the answer in *your own words* or *your own code*.
